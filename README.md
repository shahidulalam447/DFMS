## 📌 Overview

Traditional dairy farms often rely on manual record-keeping, spreadsheets, or disconnected tools. These methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and make it difficult to track livestock health, feed usage, milk production, and employee performance.

**DFMS solves this problem** by providing a unified digital platform that integrates all dairy-farm operations into a single, secure, and scalable system.

The system enables farm administrators and staff to:
- Monitor daily operations in real time  
- Maintain accurate records  
- Reduce manual workload and errors  
- Make data-driven decisions
